<p>Touch My Balls! is a very simply game. Colored balls flying around, can you touch all of them following some rules?</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>

<p>In Touch My Balls! you have to destroy balls that are flying around on the stage. There' re only few things to rember: you' ve to touch only the balls colored of the goal color, if you click on the wrong color you get a -1 on your score. Simply, no?
The main concept of the game is extended by two type of games:</p>

<p><strong>Level Mode</strong> : 10 levels. Each level has a goal number of balls you' ve to touch and a max time to do it. The time you save is converted in extra points. You need to rember that in each level there' s a finite number of balls, so take care about errors or you' ll end your game very soon.</p>

<p><strong>Arcade mode</strong> : no levels, only 180 seconds to catch as many balls you can.</p>

<h2>PLAY</h2>

<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p>This is a simple game written in <em>haxe</em> using the <em>Flixel</em> game library. C++ and flash target compile and run without problems, for mobile platform more work should be done to get a working version.</p>
