# Touch My Balls!
Touch My Balls! is a very simply game. Colored balls flying around, can you touch all of them following some rules?

## How to play

In Touch My Balls! you have to destroy balls that are flying around on the stage. There' re only few things to rember: you' ve to touch only the balls colored of the goal color, if you click on the wrong color you get a -1 on your score. Simply, no?
The main concept of the game is extended by two type of games:

**Level Mode** : 10 levels. Each level has a goal number of balls you' ve to touch and a max time to do it. The time you save is converted in extra points. You need to rember that in each level there' s a finite number of balls, so take care about errors or you' ll end your game very soon.

**Arcade mode** : no levels, only 180 seconds to catch as many balls you can.
